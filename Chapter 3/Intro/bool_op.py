# Variables
a = 4
b = 8

# Comparing a and b with different operators
print(a == 4)   # True, checks if a equals 4
print(a != 5)   # True, checks if a is not equal to 5
print(a > 8)    # False, checks if a is greater than 8
print(a < 2)    # False, checks if a is less than 2
print(a >= 3)   # True, checks if a is greater than or equal to 3
print(a <= 4)   # True, checks if a is less than or equal to 4

# Logical operations
print(a > 3 and b > 8)  # False, checks if both conditions are true
print(a > 3 or b < 8)   # True, checks if at least one condition is true
print(not(a < 3))       # True, negates the condition
